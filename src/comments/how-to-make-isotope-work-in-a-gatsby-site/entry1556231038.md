Ohhhh my goodness, thank you! I've spent hours trying to figure this out and it turns out I was missing the `iso.arrange()` on each click. The only real change on my end is that I've been using a single filter function and just passing in the desired class with each button:

```javascript
    onFilterChange = (newFilter) => {
      if (this.iso === undefined)
          this.iso = new Isotope('#portfolio-container', {
              itemSelector: '.portfolio-item',
              layoutMode: 'fitRows'
          });
      if(newFilter === '*') {
          this.iso.arrange({ filter: `*` });
      } else {
          this.iso.arrange({ filter: `.${newFilter}` });
      }
    }
```

Thanks again!
