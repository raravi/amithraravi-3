I had the exact same problem. The issue is that `Isotope` expects `window` to be defined, which fails during server-side rendering.

The fix is rather simple in this case. I followed what's suggested on Gatsby doc [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/debugging-html-builds/#fixing-third-party-modules).

```javascript
exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ stage, loaders, actions }) => {
  if (stage === 'build-html') {
    actions.setWebpackConfig({
      module: {
        rules: [
          {
            test: /isotope-layout/,
            use: loaders.null(),
          },
        ],
      },
    });
  }
};
```
