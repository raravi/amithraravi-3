Hi!

The commenting part is where you usually get stuck, especially with a static site :)

You can use Javascript to call a PHP script on the server, which will in turn process your file!

Here's a sample PHP script that I've created on GitHub: https://gist.github.com/raravi/1e08d69c8ea882ee14d5beed1728262a

Ps. Be careful!! This is a sample only, as it will overwrite the comments into the same comment.txt file every time the script is called!

Thank you for visiting!
Amith
