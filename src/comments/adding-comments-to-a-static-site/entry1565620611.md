Hi!

Setting up a blog is quite easy nowadays, expecially with Wordpress around. But if you want to do it yourself, then you need to be able to understand HTML/CSS/Javascript a bit.

Try your hand at these:
1. Jekyll, it's quite easy to start with!
2. Hugo, is quite popular right now.
3. Gatsby, based on React.
4. Next.js, based on React again.
