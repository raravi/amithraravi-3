Hi there,

Something like WordPress will be quite easy if you dont want to setup everything yourself. In this way, you can focus on the content and not worry about the technical side of maintaining a website.

If you want to setup the blog yourself, then Static Site Generators are the best way to do it. There a quite a few - *Jekyll*, *Hugo*, *Gatsby*, *Next.js*. Do check them out!

Thank you for visiting,
